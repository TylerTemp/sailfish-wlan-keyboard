# sailfish-wlan-keyboard

The sailfish-wlan-keyboard provides an easy way to use you your computer keyboard to type on your phone.

![Sailfish WlanKeyboard](http://abertschi.ch/default_public/harbour-wlan-keyboard-devel.png)

Simply connect your phone to WIFI or USB and browse a website on your computer published by your phone. Keystrokes being entered there are transmitted to your phone and inserted at your cursor position. No hassel any longer with tiny smartphone keyboards or just too big fingers.
